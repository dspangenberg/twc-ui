title: Introduction
description: DRY-er, more accessible shadcn/ui-alike React Aria components, optimized for Inertia.js with Laravel's Precognition feature built in.
order: 10

## Motivation
It was my goal to make a library of reusable components that follows the Shadcn/ui philosophy, is more accessible, and
encourages the use of the DRY principle in both my own software projects and client projects. The components are widely
based on [React Aria Components](https://react-aria.adobe.com).

Coming from Vue.js, I wanted to keep forms simple and without "blank" or repeated code. In
particular, the form components are preconfigured to operate seamlessly with Inertia.js and Laravel's precognition
feature.

## Credits

### JollyUI
Specifically, the form components are influenced by [jolbol1's](https://github.com/jolbol1) **[jolly-ui](https://www.jollyui.dev/)**. Although my library only contains a few React Aria components, his library supports the entire Adobe library.

### Taki UI
[Taki UI](https://taki-ui.com/) is a fork of shadcn/ui rebuilt with React Aria Components instead of Radix UI.

### Intent UI
[Intent UI](https://intentui.com/) is a chill set of React components, built on top of React Aria Components

### PaceUI
Initially, the library and documentation used [Pace UI](https://www.paceui.com/) as scaffolding. While this project is now realized with the React Starter kit of Laravel, some of his documentation components are furthermore the base of mine.
