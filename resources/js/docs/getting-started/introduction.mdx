title: Introduction
description: DRY, more accessible shadcn/ui-alike React Aria components, optimized for Inertia.js with Laravel's Precognition feature build in.
---

## Motivation

It was my goal to make a library of reusable components that follows the Shadcn/ui philosophy, is more accessible, and
encourages the use of the DRY principle in both my own software projects and client projects. The components are widely
based on React Aria Components.

Coming from Vue.js, I wanted to keep forms simple and without "blank" or repeated code. In
particular, the form components are preconfigured to operate seamlessly with Inertia.js and Laravel's precognition
feature.
